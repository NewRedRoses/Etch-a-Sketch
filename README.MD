# About this project 

This is a simple project based on [the Odin Project's Etch-A- Sketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) to practice manipulating the DOM with javascript. 

By default it starts with a `16x16` grid. However, it can be customized to up to ~`30x30`. The reason for this limit as opposed to the `100` from the instructions is due to constraints with the width and height.
